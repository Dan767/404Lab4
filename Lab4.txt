You see a Django welcome page that says "The install worked successfully" with the spaceship on it.

At 127.0.0.1:8000/ I receive a 404, and at 127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ I receive the following:
Hello, world. You're at the polls index.

I see the site administration page, including sections for "Authentication and Authorization"
and a section for "Polls".

6.

I see the "You're looking at question 38" message.
/vote/:
You're voting on question 38.
/results/:
You're looking at the results of question 38.
Character strings cause a 404, since it is looking for an integer to index with.
This can be fixed by using key-value pairs rather than an index.

7.

Hardcoding URLs is a bad idea, since if the main site is moved, then all of the hardcoded
URLs will break and require updating.
